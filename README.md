## Project Title: Time Series Analysis of "The Magnificent 7" Tech Stocks
Project Description:
This project focuses on a detailed time series analysis of seven leading tech companies' stock prices, collectively known as "The Magnificent 7." These companies include Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet. The analysis spans over a selected time frame, providing insights into market trends, stock performance, and predictive modeling for future stock price movements.

## Objectives:
Data Collection: Utilize Python and APIs to gather historical stock data from sources like Yahoo Finance.

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensure data integrity by handling inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze stock price trends, trading volumes, and other relevant financial metrics through visualizations and statistical techniques.

Time Series Decomposition: Break down each stock's time series to understand underlying trends, seasonality, and irregular components.

Statistical Testing: Apply tests such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to assess the stationarity of the time series.

Predictive Modeling: Develop and fine-tune time series forecasting models like ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM to predict future stock prices.

Model Evaluation: Use metrics like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE to evaluate model performance.

Insight Generation: Draw actionable insights and provide an analytical perspective on the stock performance of these tech giants.

Tools and Technologies:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, yfinance, StatsModels, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM).

Data Sources: Yahoo Finance (or other financial data providers)

## Final Deliverables:
Jupyter Notebooks: Detailed notebooks containing the code, analysis, and visualizations.

Project Report: A comprehensive report summarizing findings, methodology, model performance, and insights.

GitHub Repository: A well-documented repository containing all code, data, notebooks, and related documentation.

## Project Significance:

This project aims to showcase an in-depth analysis of some of the most influential companies in the tech sector, providing valuable insights into their stock market behavior.
